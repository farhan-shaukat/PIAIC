// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function make_car({...items}) {
    return items
}
console.log(make_car({ manufacturer: 'Toyota', model: '2021', ABS: 'Yes'}));
console.log(make_car({ manufacturer: 'Honda', model: '2023', airBag: "Yes", color: "Black"}));
